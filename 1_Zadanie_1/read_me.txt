Guess the Number

This is a simple game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program generates a random number,
and the user has to keep guessing until they get the right answer. The program gives feedback on whether the guess is
too small or too big. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

To play the game, run the guess_number() function in Python. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100,
and prompt the user to enter a number. If the user's guess is too small, the program will say "Too small!" and prompt
the user to enter another number. If the user's guess is too big, the program will say "Too big!" and prompt the user to
enter another number. If the user's guess is correct, the program will say "You win!" and tell the user how many attempts
it took to guess the number.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    import random

How to Play

    Open a text editor and copy the code for the game into a new file.

    Save the file with a meaningful name like "guess_the_number.py".

    Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can check this by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing "python --version". If you see a version number, you're good to go. If not, you'll need to install Python.

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the "guess_the_number.py" file.

    Type "python guess_the_number.py" and press enter to run the game.

    Follow the prompts to enter your guesses and see if you can guess the computer's number.

    Once the game is finished, you can close the terminal or command prompt to exit the program.

That's it! Have fun playing "Guess the Number"!
