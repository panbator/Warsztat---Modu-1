"Imagine a Number" game

This is a simple game where the computer tries to guess the number you are imagining between 0 and 1000.
How to Play

    Run the script.
    The computer will print "Imagine a number between 0 and 1000!" and "Press 'Enter' to continue".
    Press Enter to start the game.
    The computer will start guessing the number you are imagining and ask if its guess is too big, too small, or correct.
    Answer honestly and only with one of the three responses.
    The computer will continue guessing until it guesses correctly or until it reaches the maximum number of attempts.
    If the computer guesses correctly, it will print the number of attempts it took.
    If the maximum number of attempts is reached and the computer did not guess the number correctly, it will print "User cheated!".

Game Rules

    The computer has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number.
    The number should be between 0 and 1000, inclusive.
    The player can only respond with "Too big", "Too small", or "You win". Any other input will raise an error and prompt the player to try again.
